<h1 id="first-blog-post">First Blog Post</h1>

<p>Welp, this is it! The goal today was to get the site up and running and I’m proud to have done that!</p>

<p>This won’t be much of a blog post, I won’t lie. But very soon, I’ll be writing actually meaningful things. I don’t know what the frequency of posts will be but I’m glad to have gotten the ball rolling.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
